# public
* the "private" content is evolving towards a "launch" of this repository
* * For the moment, Private content is shared with selected subGroups via Notion.
* * * MicroContent should be as Public as possible.  ( See HeadStarts for FocusedContext benefits )
* * * * Cj seems most interested in this tool
* * * * * try to interact with Rst in this manner
* * ideally this will evolve into a DAO - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization
* review the entire GitHub structure with an aim of simplification
* consider a OnceMonthlu update to neglected repos as an indicator to unexpected guests
